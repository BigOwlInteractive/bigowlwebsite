Big Owl Interactive is a game development company established amongst friend, based in Batavia, Illinois. We are the biggest (and only) game dev company in our hometown!

This company was born out of a desire to build upon a medium we have all spent years enjoying. More than just an avenue for profit, we want to make experiences that are both fun to play, and thoughtfully engage with the ongoing dialogue of the game industry. We hope to create worlds and communicate ideas that leave a lasting impression on our players.

	Just a kid that liked video games enough to download the Unity engine one Friday evening after school. I learned to code watching intensely fascinating YouTube tutorials and reading supremely boring APIs. I have a love for detailed, well crafted, and lived-in worlds of fantasy and science fiction. BOI was born from the fires of disappointment and mediocrity, fancy way of saying I got fed up with a game one night and figured I could do better. Shortly after I contacted my colleagues, we got to work, and the rest is history.
