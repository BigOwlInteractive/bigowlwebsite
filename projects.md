# Re:Wire

Re:Wire is a short puzzle game, with 20 hand-created levels based around the correct placement of a series of wires in an electrical circuit, using a series of input sources to correctly connect them to a series of output receivers. The graphics will be simple and the mechanics should be relatively easy to understand, but with some added complexity as the levels progress.

Should time and staffing allow, the game will be accompanied by extensive writing and narration detailing the background of the world the game takes place in and the playerâ€™s character. However, this story is optional, allowing players to enjoy a more traditional experience if they so choose.



# Superpowers

Superpowers is a Cold War themed brawler made for the 2021 Historical Game Jam on Itch.io. Take control of one of three somewhat historically accurate Cold War leaders and fight on two definitely not accurate stages! This game was developed over a two week period.

# Glorious Dawn
<img src="/assets/images/GloriousDawn0.png"/>

Glorious Dawn is a "Space Opera Simulator" being developed by the team at Big Owl Interactive. A highly ambitious, highly long term project, we hope to follow in the footsteps of games like Stellaris and Dwarf Fortress to create an all-encompassing, engaging Sci-Fi game based on the cosmos you create and the stories you tell in it. In the most basic sense our game strives to be the Sci-Fi sandbox upon which you can build a universe of your own. Take command of a stellar civilization and shape an ever-changing galaxy to your liking. Form alliances, fight wars, study the darkest secrets of the universe, or just set out and explore the stars that hang suspended around you.

Development has been halted for the time being, but we still intend to continue our work on this project.
