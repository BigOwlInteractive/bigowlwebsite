## Re:Wire

Re:Wire is a Sci-Fi puzzle game, with 20 hand-created levels based around the correct placement of a series of wires in an electrical circuit. The player must navigate complex obstacles and level layouts in order to complete the circuits and advance. Unusual for a puzzle game, Re:Wire features an compelling, in-depth narrative. Players can experience both the engaging mechanics and the complicated world that Re:Wire inhabits.

This game is currently under development.



## Superpowers

Superpowers is a Cold War themed brawler made for the 2021 Historical Game Jam on Itch.io. Take control of one of three somewhat historically accurate Cold War leaders and fight on two definitely not accurate stages! This game was developed over a two week period.

## Glorious Dawn
<img src="/assets/images/GloriousDawn0.png"/>

Glorious Dawn is a "Space Opera Simulator". A highly ambitious, highly long term project, we hope to follow in the footsteps of games like Stellaris and Dwarf Fortress to create an all-encompassing, engaging Sci-Fi game based on the cosmos you create and the stories you tell in it. In the most basic sense our game strives to be the Sci-Fi sandbox upon which you can build a universe of your own. Take command of a stellar civilization and shape an ever-changing galaxy to your liking. Form alliances, fight wars, study the darkest secrets of the universe, or just set out and explore the stars that hang suspended around you.

Development is currently halted, but we still intend to continue our work on this project when time allows.
